Submission #1 - UX Fundamentals
# Alex's Markdown Submission
The following document will contain a list of traits I think I will be successful with, as well as those I will have difficulty with using Markdown. Also included is my list of goals from the **Bloc** program.

### Successes
1. I have previous experience with Markdown, so I believe I will pick it up easily. 
2. I am a fast-learner. 
3. I know how to use the internet to search for help with Markdown. 
4. I find the concepts relatively straight-forward. 

### Difficulties
1. The biggest hurdle is memorizing Markdown so that I don't always have to reference a Markdown cheatsheet.
2. Learning how to use Markdown within code, like Python.
3. Learning best practices when using Markdown. 

### Bloc Goals
- Gain the technical skills needed to get a job as a UX Designer when I graduate.
- Graduate with an understanding of what I need to do, to get where I want to be.
- Discover which area of UX suits me best (and which areas I struggle with or simply don't enjoy).
